# 13. Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

```text
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

  
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* I can be placed before V \(5\) and X \(10\) to make 4 and 9. 
* X can be placed before L \(50\) and C \(100\) to make 40 and 90. 
* C can be placed before D \(500\) and M \(1000\) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:

```text
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```

Example 4:

```text
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

Example 5:

```text
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

先處理特殊規則 4與9 , 然後蓋掉處理過的字串.

最後在處理通用規則 

```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        hash_set = {"I": 1, "V": 5, "X": 10, "L": 50, "C": 100, "D": 500, "M":1000}
        reverse_hash = {"IV": 4, "IX": 9, "XL": 40, "XC": 90, "CD": 400, "CM": 900}
        
        res = 0
        for element in reverse_hash:
            if element in s:
                res += reverse_hash[element]
                s = s.replace(element, "")

        for element in s:
            res += hash_set[element]

        return res
        
```



```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        conversionDict = {"I":1, "V": 5, "X":10, "L":50, "C":100, "D": 500, "M":1000}
        subtractionDict = {"IV":4, "IX":9, "XL":40, "XC":90, "CD":400, "CM":900}
        number = 0
        for j in subtractionDict:
            if j in s:
                number = number + subtractionDict[j]
                s = s.replace(j,"")
        for each in s:
            number = number + conversionDict[each]
        return number
```
